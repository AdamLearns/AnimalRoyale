        Twitch chat inside Minecraft
            First step is just getting Twitch chat inside of Minecraft chat

            It constructs the font out of blocks and places them in the world and "scrolls the chat:"
                Imagine reconstructing emotes in the world

                To delete a message, it could turn into TNT and blow up
                    [15:59] ImaCatLolol: Might want to look into the map item system, and how blocks use map colors to display on maps.

            Twitch chat - message reader
                parser - text + emotes
                    Text - font builder
                Emotes - pixellation library
                    color approximator

            [16:08] xxComet: Emotes need a lot more blocks than text though
                Emotes probably would just show NEAR the text rather than with the message?

            To save world space, we could render in the Z direction rather than in Y direction like what you'd be used to reading

        Add a boomerang
        Make a questing system
        Make Zelda or WoW as much as possible
        Magic system
            Mana
        Tower defense?
        I could set my lights could match the current biome
            [15:10] solstynn: you could simply have the lights mimic the light level of the block the player is standing on
        Think of any StarCraft or WarCraft III custom map and consider making that sort of thing, e.g. MOBA
        Twitch integration? Spawn cows or chickens for everyone in chat?
            Minecraft light control? Control my lights in my room with various colors of wool
        MINECRAFT PIANO - have people jump on blocks in Minecraft to activate notes on my piano

        [09:00] EmberCM: Simple breakdown: Datapacks are essentially plugins for Vanilla Minecraft / Single Player and are made in configuration files. Plugins are made for servers and are made in Java. Plugins and Datapacks don't add anything new to Minecraft, but can change the gameplay completely (similar to mcmmo). Mods are also made in Java, generally using the Forge API, and can add new items, mobs, etc to the game (pretty much anything).

        [08:53] CyborgCyprezz: Consider learning Minecraft Data Packs instead of mods. It's "modding" for vanilla minecraft. Much more structured and officially supported.

        Which NPCs can I create in Minecraft?
        How would I control their behaviors?
        How do I set up a new arena?
        How do I control fall damage?
            Override an event?
        Should we ever generate different terrain?
        How do I control my "camera"?
        What kind of cleanup tasks do we need in between games?
        How will we show a leaderboard in the game?
        How do we hook up Twitch chat?
        How do we set up the game loop?

        Ideas
            Scorched Earth in Minecraft controlled by Twitch chat
                Randomly pick NPCs from sheep, cow, pig, etc. so that people can identify themselves
                    Maybe you can also pick an NPC since there are multiple skins
                    You should be able to set your avatar
                        Maybe only pick NPCs with the same general size or code my own collision system?

                    Maybe make little dirt platforms for everybody to start on? Or just raycast them downward onto the terrain

                    Make sure you can only join the game during the initialization section of it
                        That way you don't join mid-fight

                    If you die during the initialization, we should just recreate your sheep. Alternatively, we could spawn a patch of ground above the lava.

                The "camera" might need to move - maybe we do this by relocating the player and changing their lookAt values

                Fall damage - probably need to make sure players don't die immediately upon falling

                We generate a terrain with irregularities and everything
                We place all of chat who opts in. They can do "identify <color>" to make their character glow to figure out where they are.
                They can adjust direction and power
                    In chat, you control all things with one command
                        SHOOT turn 0-359 turret_angle -90-90 power 0-100 duration 10-100
                        MOVE turn 0-359 distance 0-100
                Everybody shoots at the same time maybe? A TNT thing flies out? Players have lots of health to compensate for the chaos.
                    Everyone takes their action after 20 seconds, so you get 20 seconds to see what happened and type the next command?
                        If you don't choose an action, it picks what you had last time

                Maybe you can choose to move OR shoot?

                [14:36] EmberCM: @Adam13531 Here's a death handler if you wanna PM/broadcast the death names to Twitch https://hastebin.com/letiwasiya.java

                People want to see who killed whom (or how you died)

                Extra ideas
                    Add in different abilities (maybe you spend points to buy these weapons?)
                        Bouncing TNT
                        Sticky TNT for people who have the high ground
                            I would likely need an onTick and to detect when it hits something
                        Rail gun
                        Fireball gun?
                            [12:50] EmberCM: If you spawn a Fire charge entity you can shoot it Adam
                        Create a wall - or spew terrain
                        Being able to fly or teleport?
                        Repair
                        TREE DESTROYER - just immediately light all trees on fire?
                        LAVA GUN - we could just make the lava travel slowly
                        Hook that pulls people to you?
                        There has to be something to stop people from being "invincible" at the top of a tree, e.g. a "push" weapon that bumps the player by ~2 tiles
                            Maybe this just automatically happens every so often?

                        Some kind of "confusion" weapon that does setAi(true) on enemies

                        Swap-a-port - ability to switch locations with a random player

                    Just pull ideas from Bot Land?

                    Weapon upgrades, kill streaks

                    Keep track of the leaderboard (kills, remaining life)

                We could prevent entities from spawning by detecting their spawn events and doing something based off of that

            As players die out, we should make rounds last a shorter amount of time
                Eventually, it should just be one action per second so that two people aren't waiting forever for matches to conclude

            We could detect which message you've clicked in Minecraft and do something based on that
                Maybe you can type messages right from Minecraft by selecting characters from a "keyboard"?

            We could have a game where Twitch chat controls NPCs with their messages
                Maybe this has RPG elements?
                Maybe everyone in Twitch chat is an NPC?

            Twitch chat could interact with the world via messages
                Maybe it's just hash tags like #explode or #blue to customize their message?

            A city where people can walk their NPCs around

            Split chat into two teams based on names or hashes or something
                Each team controls an avatar
                The streamer puts the "Arena" into a top-down view
                Maybe there's a third team that controls environmental hazards?
                    There could actually be multiple Minecraft instances running to show this stuff
                        identify blue ← make your character glow blue for a bit
                            Maybe just every person with a certain name color controls that color NPC
                            Some people in chat have random name colors

            Chicken race? Navigate a lava or parkour course?

            Cooperative single-player voting-based game where chat makes choices like "drink a potion"

            This could be a plug-in that we market at Twitch streamers

            Which NPCs can I create in Minecraft?
                Can you color sheep in any color?
                Can you color chickens?
            Can I make the sheep glow?
                I know for sure that I did this yesterday, but I don't know how
                    This will apparently work
                    https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/change-glowing-color.402831/
            How would I control their behaviors?
                I want to rotate them 0-359°   (YAW)
                I want to angle their little sheep faces -90-90° (PITCH)

                Math.PI for yaw is south
                Math.PI for pitch is straight ahead
                    Actually, changing it to *2 /2 didn't make a difference, so it's probably in degrees
            How do I set up a new arena?
                Teleport myself to a random spot in the entire world and hope that we've never seen that before
                    After teleporting, stake out an arena
                        Look at it
                        Make sure we're high enough above it

                    world.getBiome IS a function

                    Set yaw to 0 and pitch to 45

                IsNewChunk to figure out if we've seen it before
                Get the biome to see if it's ocean
            How do we stop the sheep from taking damage from NPCs?
                [10:02] Corax191: Adam13531 /gamerule doMobSpawning False means no mobs spawn
                We could override the damage event instead of deleting NPCs entirely
            How do I control fall damage?
                Override an event?
            Try to spawn sheep in the Arena
            Set me to flying if I wasn't already
                Spectator mode will do that
            Make sure two sheep don't spawn too close to each other
            Make sure someone doesn't drop onto lava - they should have a patch of ground near them
            My desheeping doesn't work
            Should we ever generate different terrain?
            How do I control my "camera"?
            Make a command that puts me back into the default spectator position
            Look into adding a nametag
                [09:41] rhymu8354: It looks like maybe you can have an always-visible name tag by adding an Armor Stand that rides the entity (I know, weird, right?) https://gaming.stackexchange.com/questions/235574/how-can-i-summon-a-mob-with-an-always-visible-name-tag

                We can get a nameplate mod to increase the size
                    I'll just rely on chat having a command like !identifyself
            Try world.getBiome to potentially improve performance
            See how I can turn off the weather
            What kind of cleanup tasks do we need in between games?

                I think it may be paging frequently (or at least the JVM's concept of paging)?
                    Apparently the JVM allocates all memory at once, so I don't think paging would be a problem, but the JVM probably has its own concept of paging

                    We can test by giving the JVM more memory

            https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/BlockingQueue.html

            [16:25] thels: I need to head off for the night ( after midnight here in Scotland! ) - if you look into the blocking queue, it's an interface, the default implementation you probably want to look into examples for is called "BlockingQueue<Message> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10);"

            My assumption is that I'm going to have to batch all of the events that I get from Twitch and only perform them every so often

            I'm pretty sure Twitch chat was slowing everything down even when there was no interaction with the world.
                Yes, it's slowing down no matter what (even if I have a completely blank event handler), and also, my CPU usage is around 90%, so it's not absolutely maxed out.

                I'm going to try removing the event handler entirely to try to isolate where this is coming from. Perhaps there's a workaround here, and perhaps I can try a different library.
                    Removing the event handler still has lag.

                    I wonder if we just put in arbitrary delays on the server if we'd notice lag on the client. "/tps" shows 20 for the last minute, although Twitch chat is only spamming for a couple of seconds, so it may not be long enough to significantly bring down the average.
                        Apparently the server DOES go above 20 to try to hit the average of 20, so this won't be a problem

                    It looks like they make a new thread every single time an IRC message is received, not even a chat message
                        It also looks like they spawn a new event for EVERY single IRC message
                        https://github.com/twitch4j/twitch4j/blob/c26e439435347d8fdac510515a5df178c9150a1e/chat/src/main/java/com/github/twitch4j/chat/events/IRCEventHandler.java#L39

            See if Twitch's APIs are being called synchronously
                There's some problem here. Having Twitch chat spam definitely causes lag.
                    Maybe I need all of Twitch chat running on another thread

                No matter what, I can't interact with Bukkit asynchronously, so I'll have to figure that out.

            Option #1: remove hazards completely (no water or lava) from the arena itself
